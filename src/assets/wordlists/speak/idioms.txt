A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Call it a day
Cut them some slack
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get out of hand
Get it out of your system
Get your act together
Benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Hit the sack
It's not rocket science
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
On the ball
Pull someone's leg
Pull yourself together
So far so good
Speak of the devil
That's the last straw
The best of both worlds
Time flies when you're having fun
To get bent out of shape
To make matters worse
Under the weather
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wrap your head around it
You can say that again
Your guess is as good as mine
Acid test
At boiling point
Bells and whistles
Bent out of shape
Blind with science
Blow a fuse
Cog in the machine
Cutting edge
Fire on all cylinders
Get your wires crossed
In layman's terms
It's not rocket science
Know what makes someone tick
Light years ahead
On another planet
On the same wavelength
Out of this world
Reinvent the wheel
Run out of steam
Silver surfer
Sputnik moment
The bottom line
Up and running
Well-oiled machine
Apple of my eye
Bull-headed
Change horses in midstream
Cry wolf
Eat crow
Hot potato
